This is NREL's SOLPOS 2.0 from http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/codesandalgorithms/solpos/
In addition to the original files (solpos.c, solpos00.h and stest00.c) I, Stefan Talpalaru,
have added a .vapi file, a translation to Vala of the test and a script to build it.

All the files in this directory are in the Public Domain.
